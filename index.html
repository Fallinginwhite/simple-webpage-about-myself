  <!-- Below here is my main paragraph for the webpage -->
  <div class="maintext">
	<p>Hello! This is a simple webpage i've made using HTML and CSS this webpage is to tell you a little bit about me.I've withheld my name for privacy reasons. As you can see on the left there are 4 images. The cat on the very far left is my eldest cat, her name is Tiger, and on the right next to her is my youngest cat whose name is Wolf. We aren't too sure on their breeds but it looks like Tiger could be a little persian and it looks like Wolf could be a little MaineCoon. Now onto the next two images, If you're aware of  the game "League of Legends" you'll know what both the images are. The bird-like character on the bottom left is Azir, he's my main champion in the game, and on the image to the right of him you'll see the Esports team "T1" formerly known as "SKT T1". I've been a big supporter of this team since I started playing League of Legends. 
	
	<br>
	<br> Anyway, as you can see on the right of this text, I've left a link to my github, there are only a few basic python programs on there right now but hopefully I will add programs in other languages on there soon and make more advanced projects too, I may also add my codecademy profile at a later date.
	
	<br>
	<br>Thanks for taking the time to look at my webpage!
